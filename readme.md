# Dotfile-configs

## Installation

1. Clone the repo into `.config` in the `$HOME`directory
2. Run the `build_symlink.sh` (WIP) to create the symlinks to the config files

## TODO
- Add zsh installation
- Different installations depending on the OS
- Linux: sudo apt-get install zsh
- Mac OS: brw install zsh
